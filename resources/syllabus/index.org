* Course Overview  

Physics is the study of matter, energy, and their interactions. This course emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and scientific inquiry. Topics will include motion, forces, energy, waves, electricity, and magnetism, with real-world applications. The course combines theoretical learning with practical, hands-on experiments.



* Course Goals  

- Develop an understanding of core physics principles.  
- Apply mathematical models to describe physical phenomena.  
- Engage in scientific practices such as experimentation, data analysis, and modeling.  
- Connect physics concepts to technology and everyday life.  


* Course Structure  

The course is divided into units, each lasting approximately 2–4 weeks. Each unit includes lectures, hands-on labs, problem-solving sessions, and assessments.
