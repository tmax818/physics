\subsection{Wave Types}

\subsubsection{mechanical waves}

    \frametitle{mechanical waves}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item require a medium, or material(i.e. gas, liquid, solid), for transmission
        \item energy comes from a vibrating source
        \item the wave passes through a medium, but the medium itself does not travel along with the wave as energy is transmitted.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{electromagnetic waves}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{electromagnetic waves}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item do not need a medium
        \item include visible light as well as infrared and ultraviolet light, microwaves, X-rays, and gamma rays.
        \item  These waves are generated by oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields from charged particles
        \item  All electromagnetic waves in a vacuum move at the same speed. This speed, 3 Ã— 108 m/s, is known as the speed of light and is represented by the letter c.
