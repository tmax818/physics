\begin{tabular}{llll}
term & lesson & page & definition\\[0pt]
\hline
\hline
frame of reference & Lesson 1 &  & a system for specifying the precise location of objects in space and time\\[0pt]
vector & Lesson 1 &  & a physical quantity that has both magnitude and a direction\\[0pt]
velocity & Lesson 1 &  & the speed of an object in a particular direction\\[0pt]
acceleration & Lesson 1 &  & the rate at which velocity changes over time; an object accelerates if its speed, direction, or both change\\[0pt]
gravity & Lesson 1 &  & a force of attraction between objects that is due to their masses and that decreases as the distance between the objects increases\\[0pt]
\hline
force & Lesson 2 &  & an action exerted on an object that may change the object's state of rest or motion; force has magnitude and direction\\[0pt]
friction & Lesson 2 &  & a force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are in contact\\[0pt]
normal force & Lesson 2 &  & a force that acts on an object lying on a surface and acts in a direction perpendicular to the surface\\[0pt]
weight & Lesson 2 &  & a measure of the gravitational force exerted on an object; its value can change with the location of the object in the universe\\[0pt]
\hline
tradeoff & Lesson 3 &  & the giving up of one thing in return for another, often applied to the engineering design process\\[0pt]
iterate & Lesson 3 &  & to do again or repeat; in design testing, the results of each repetition are used to modify the next version of the design\\[0pt]
criteria & Lesson 3 &  & (plural, criteria) the specific requirements and standards a design must meet; in engineering design, a specific requirement that a design or solution should meet, often determined when defining a problem\\[0pt]
constraint & Lesson 3 &  & a restriction or limitation; in engineering design, a limitation that a design or solution must stay within, often determined when defining a problem\\[0pt]
decision matrix & Lesson 3 &  & a decision-making tool for evaluating several options at the same time\\[0pt]
prototype & Lesson 3 &  & a test model of a product\\[0pt]
stress & Lesson 3 &  & the force per unit area within an object; the internal resistance of an object to an applied force\\[0pt]
